Sass has a set of powerful control directives that I find fascinating: `@if`, `@for`, `@while`, and `@each`.

In my "hue bump" experiment, I used a `@for` loop in Sass along with the `nth-of-type` CSS pseudo class to bump up the hue of each word.


    
    
    <code>$hue-bump: 15;
    
    @for $n from 2 through 6 {
        h1:nth-of-type(#{$n}) {
            color: hsl($n * $hue-bump, 100%, 50%);
        }
    }</code>
    



I looped from the second header (`h1:nth-of-type(2)`) to the sixth header (`h1:nth-of-type(6)`) adding 15 (or the `$hue-bump` amount) more to the hue number in each headerâ€™s `hsl` value.

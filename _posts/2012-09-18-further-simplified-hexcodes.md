Hexadecimal codes, like `#2faced`, are interpreted as colors. [For a long time now](https://twitter.com/ChrisNager/status/83651049558253568), I've wanted the ability to further shorten hexcodes.

Take for example the hexcode for the color black. It can be written as `#000000` or `#000`. I think we should also be able to write `#0` to represent black.

<!-- more -->

To take this a step further, we know `#f16` is the shorthand for `#ff1166`, so why can't `#16` be the shorthand for `#161616`?

In my ideal world:
`#3` would be equivalent to `#333333`,
`#7` would be equivalent to `#777777`,
`#b4` would be equivalent to `#b4b4b4`,
`#5d` would be equivalent to `#5d5d5d`,
et cetera, et cetera.

This technique seems like an appropriate short(er)hand for hexcodes and would save a tiny bit of time and bytes.

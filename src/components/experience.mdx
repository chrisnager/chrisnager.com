I've had the pleasure of working with some of the smartest, kindest, most creative people across a variety of industries. I started my professional career imeediately after college at a full service agency where …. My next jump was a move to New York where I went through an aquisition and then worked at Salesforce for a number of years. While there, I worked in Professional Services, Product, and Engineering (started the Prodcut Visions team). Then, I worked at IEX, where I helped launch America's newest stock exchange with an ethos about transparency. For the last couple of years, I've been building Air, a media asset management startup.

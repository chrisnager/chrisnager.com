# Hi, I'm Chris.

I create usable, responsive, future-friendly sites and apps with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Haml, Sass, BEM, OOCSS, RWD, Markdown, PHP, Gulp, Grunt, Bower, npm, Jekyll, Vim, and Git.

I'm ambitious, self-driven, and enthusiastic about the future of the web. I currently work in New York City as a Front End Engineer at Salesforce.com. Using the latest web technologies and languages, I strive to build beautifully designed and masterfully coded websites and apps. I continually learn from and contribute to the web community and constantly find myself taking on self-initiated [side projects](/projects). I merge the gap between designer and developer by taking my designs from pen and paper to usable, performance-first online experiences.
